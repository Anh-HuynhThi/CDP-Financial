# CDP-financial
 We are going to use Kanban board for the project management. 
* Pleace, plan your project first.
* Examine the dataset for the possible issues
* Develop the system of Key Performance Indicators (or the system of widgets that should be shown). Please keep in mind:
- you need to have at least 12 widgets that describe your data,
- you have at least 2 widgets that should reflect forecasted value,
- dashboard's style should reflect the domain.
* Develop the idea of your dashboard:
 - what exactly you want to show?
 - what should be the layout?
 - which widgets represent the most powerful insights?
* Your dashboard should give the possibility to filter the data
* Describe the idea of the dashboard and each widget (what you want to show, why the particular chart is chosen), calculations in the readme file.
* After your dashboard is ready, please, create a presentation.

Non-functional requirements:
1. Use the corporate colors of the product
